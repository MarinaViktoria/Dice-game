# Dice Game

This project is a part of [The Complete JavaScript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by `Jonas Schmedtmann`.
The design and structure were provided as part of the course curriculum, and I did not design the website from scratch. The primary purpose of this project is to practice and apply the concepts learned during the course.

## Rules

User 1 rolls the dice. If the number is everything but not 1, it will be added to his current score.

User rolls the dice again... and again... until he decides to hold the number. In this case his current score will be added to his total score.

Or the User 1 gets 1. In this case nothing will be added to his total score and another player - User 2 - gets his chance to play.

A player, who gets 100 points wins!

You can reset the game and start one more time.
